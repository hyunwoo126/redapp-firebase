        The top 3 mobile phone manufacturers - Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo store owns roughly 27% of the market combined. With the increasing amount of domestic mobile phone users and the pre-installed app stores from these phone makers, the app stores backed by these hardware giants may soon take over the top 3 storeâ€™s market share.

        Alibaba has been increasing its market share by acquiring other app stores. The Wandoujia store, which was one of the top 10 mobile stores in 2015, was acquired by Alibaba and is now officially part of Aliapp store. Aliapp currently possess 5% the market share but its major plaforms - Aliapp, UC, Wandoujia, and PP app stores will keep expanding its influence on top 10 store list.

        The old fashioned top 10 stores - Anzhi store and Vivo store are still holding up their shrinking 6% market share yet they are not what they used to be few years ago due to high app promotion charge and harsh app uploading requirements. Their limited market share might decrease even more as other big players keep expanding their influence.

        Lenovo store has never been a major player in the league, yet its low end mobile phones allows it to maintain its small market share of 2% which may be an interesting opportunity for app developers.
